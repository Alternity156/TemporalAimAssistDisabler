# TemporalAimAssistDisabler
 A mod that disables Temporal Aim Assist

Temporal Aim Assist is a hard-coded aim assist in the game that is not affected by the aim assist setting in Gameplay Settings. It keeps in memory your aim during the last 50 miliseconds and when you fire it will take the best aim in that list instead of your current aim. This mod disables that.
